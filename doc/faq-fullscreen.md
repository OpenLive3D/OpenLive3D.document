# Why OpenLive3D Stop when I play games?

TL;DR: Don't use fullscreen mode!

OpenLive3D is a website. Currently, across all browsers that we had tested, the screen rendering will all stop when another program enters fullscreen.

In our research, 2022-11-27, there is no add-on that can bypass this limitation in modern browsers.

We will have to recommend people to use windows mode when playing games if you are using OpenLive3D.

A possible solution that we are still researching is to modify the [chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/), which is basically building your own browser. This is a huge task and we are not sure about the direction of this yet.
