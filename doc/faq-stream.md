# How to Start Streaming?

OpenLive3D is a website that connects your camera motion capture and links the motion to your 3D vrm model.

To start streaming, you will need another software to capture the windows and screen and convert it into a video source for streaming or video recording.

A known software that works for many OpenLive3D members is [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/). This software provides windows / mac / linux support and we had tested video recording and streaming with it.
