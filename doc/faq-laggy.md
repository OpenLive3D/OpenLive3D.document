# Why is my Website Laggy?

OpenLive3D uses hardware acceleration in your browser.

By checking the [Activity-Monitor on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-hk/guide/activity-monitor/actmntr43452/mac) or [Task-Manager on Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_Manager_(Windows)), we can see the CPU and GPU usage of our applications.

When OpenLive3D is running, we should see the GPU usage increase. If the GPU usage remains `0` and it is laggy, you might have to enable hardware acceleration in your browser.

Here, we have a few reference to enable hardware acceleration in browsers that you can check:
 - [Lifewire - Hardware Acceleration in Chrome](https://www.lifewire.com/hardware-acceleration-in-chrome-4125122)
